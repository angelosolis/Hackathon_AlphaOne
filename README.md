# AlphaOne Real Estate Platform

## Project Overview

AlphaOne is a modern real estate platform designed to connect buyers with properties through intelligent AI-assisted interactions. The platform features a sophisticated property listing system with an integrated AI assistant that can provide detailed information about properties, schedule viewings, and answer buyer questions.

## Key Features

- View high-quality property images with an interactive gallery
- Filter properties by various criteria
- See key property details at a glance (price, bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage)

### Property Details
- Explore in-depth property information with full-screen image gallery
- View property specifications, features, and amenities
- Check property status (Active, Pending, Sold)
- Contact agents directly from property listings

### AI Property Assistant
- Chat with an intelligent AI assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o model
- Get instant answers to questions about property details, pricing, location, and features
- Schedule property viewings through conversational interface
- Voice input capability for hands-free interaction (speech-to-text)
- Text-to-speech responses for an accessible, audio-based experience
- Property context-aware responses for personalized assistance

### User Accounts
- Secure login and registration system
- Profile management for buyers, sellers and agents
- Tracked interactions and saved properties

## Technical Architecture

The platform is built using:

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn-ui components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express server
- **Database**: Amazon DynamoDB for scalable NoSQL data storage
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 for property images
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-4o for intelligent property assistance

## DynamoDB Data Structure

The platform utilizes a sophisticated DynamoDB schema with tables for:
- Users (buyers, sellers, agents)
- Properties
- Property details and media
- Transactions and documents
- AI interactions

## Getting Started

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Start the backend server
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

## AI Assistant

The AI assistant is directly powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o model and is contextually aware of all property details:
1. Each property's complete data (specifications, pricing, features, images) is fed to the AI model
2. The AI uses this property-specific context to answer questions accurately and relevantly
3. When users inquire about a property, the assistant already knows all details without requiring lookup
4. The system maintains context throughout the conversation, referencing the specific property being discussed

This creates a deeply personalized experience where the AI functions as a knowledgeable real estate agent with instant recall of every property detail. Users can ask specific questions about features, compare to market averages, or inquire about aspects not explicitly listed in the general description.

The assistant features a complete voice interface:
- Speech-to-text conversion for user input (voice commands and questions)
- Text-to-speech synthesis for AI responses (audio playback)
- Multi-modal interaction allowing both text and voice communication

This creates a truly conversational experience accessible to users on any device, especially beneficial for mobile users or those with accessibility needs.

## Future Enhancements

- 3D virtual property tours
- Mortgage calculator and financing options
- Neighborhood insights and analytics
- Advanced property matching based on user preferences
- Full voice conversation capabilities
